# LearnPythonPoker
You down with the LPP?!?  The start of a collaboration amongst r/LearnPython to, well, learn python while creating a poker app!

The ultimate goal is to create a poker platform.  To create a virtual poker room with no rake or illegal activity, just 
a place to play private games with friends and acquaintances.  

I'm thinking a web-app would probably be best. My intent is to write in python, eventually convert to something like Django
and perhaps use something like SQLAlchemy/MongoDB for the backend data piece.  

Eventually, and this is sort of pipedream, I'd be interested to see if we could even host it on something like a Raspberry PI and 
than have players connect over wifi to use cell phones as controller, with the table displayed on a tv.  Now I'm just getting 
ahead of myself!

So yea, this is a very informal start while on break at work.  I'll post more when I get home!
